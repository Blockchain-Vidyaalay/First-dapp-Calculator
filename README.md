# First-dapp-Calculator

In this series we will be learning how to **Create a Dapp Application** from scratch. We will be using tools like:

1. Truffle
2. Ganache
3. Web3-Providers
4. Web3Js
5. Metamask

We will be creating a small Calculator Dapp application where the calculation will be done by the smart contract. We will also deploy the contract on the testnet for 
others to test it.

## Videos:

1. **basic_project_structure**: Here we have setup a basic project structure using truffle for writing smart contract. We then wrote a smart contract for
our Calculator Dapp and compiled it using truffle.

2. **web3_interaction**: Here we have used web3js library to interact with our smart contract. We will first establishe a connection with smart contract and then we will 
use web3-provider to call the functions of smart contract.

3. **frontend_for_dapp**: In this video we have covered how to develop a frontend for our dapp application using ReactJs. We have also covered how to interact with smart contract using web application made with ReactJS. We have first established the connection using web3Providers and then tried to interact with the smart contract.
