# First-dapp-Calculator

In this series we will be learning how to **Create a Dapp Application** from scratch. We will be using tools like:

1. Truffle
2. Ganache
3. Web3-Providers
4. Web3Js
5. Metamask

We will be creating a small Calculator Dapp application where the calculation will be done by the smart contract. We will also deploy the contract on the testnet for 
others to test it.

## Videos:

1. **basic_project_structure**: Here we have setup a basic project structure using truffle for writing smart contract. We then wrote a smart contract for
our Calculator Dapp and compiled it using truffle.

2. **web3_interaction**: Here we have used web3js library to interact with our smart contract. We will first establishe a connection with smart contract and then we will 
use web3-provider to call the functions of smart contract.
