# Frontend for our Calculator dapp application

This is the 3rd directory of the playlist . In this project we have created a front-end for our Calculator Dapp using reactJs. Then we have connected our application with the truffle running in the background using web3Provider so that we can interact with the smart contract.  

## Tools required

1. Node and npm
2. Truffle 

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Move to this folder
3. npm install
4. Got to `basic_project_structure` folder and start truffle in the terminal : `truffle develop`
5. Compile the contract: `compile`
6. Migrate the contract: `migrate --reset`
7. Copy the `Calculator.json` file from `build/contract/` folder
8. Delete the `Calculator.json` file there and Paste the copied json file in this repo inside src directory.
9. Open other terminal for running the react application
10. Put npm start to start the application

## Note: 
If you face any issues with running the code kindly put you comments in the comment box or create a PR for me.
